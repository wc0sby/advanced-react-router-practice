### Setup
* Fork, Clone, yarn install, yarn start
* Slight quirk - refreshing doesn't work from any path other than the default one so you will have to go back to the default path to refresh

### App.js
* Import BrowserRouter,Switch and Route from react-router-dom
* Import components needed
* Create the appropriate routes `{/* PUT YOUR ROUTES HERE */}`
* Make sure the default route goes at the bottom
* Make sure BrowserRouter wraps everything
* Make sure you use the component prop, not render.

### Routes
* /              -> Dashboard
* /charts        -> Charts
* /tables        -> Tables
* /settings      -> Settings
* /wall          -> Wall
* /profiles      -> Profiles
* /marquee/:text -> Marquee
* /profile/:id   -> Profile

### Create these components. The content of the components is not important, just put anything `<div> whatever </div>`
* Charts.js
* Tables.js
* Settings.js
* Wall.js

### Existing components
* Profiles.js
    * Import Link from react-router-dom
    * change the `<a>` to be a Link that links to `/profile/ + user.id`
* Profile.js 
    * Change the hard coded 0 with the value from the parameter id
* Dashboard.js
* Marquee
    * replace the hard coded "hello" with the text parameter from the route

### SideNav
* Import Link from react-router-dom
* Create links to all the routes except Profile
* Hard code some links to Marquee
    * /marquee/iloveroutes
    * /marquee/reactrouterrules
    * …etc
